This topic describes how to install and configure Apigee Edge Installer for Pivotal Platform. Edge Installer for Pivotal Platform lets Pivotal Platform developers use [Apigee Edge for Private Cloud v4.19.01](https://docs.apigee.com/private-cloud/v4.19.01/overview) (Edge).


### Installation Overview

During the installation, the following events occur:

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Ops Manager creates a virtual machine (VM) for the Apigee Mirror Repo to host the Apigee <code style="color: #222222; background-color: #e6e6e6; padding: 1px 2px;">yum</code> repository, and makes sure that subsequent VMs have access to this repository.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Ops Manager then creates VMs and installs the Edge components that do not depend on other components, such as Zookeeper. Each Edge component is installed on its own VM.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">Ops Manager then creates the next VM and installs the Edge components that do not depend on any other component except the components that have already been installed.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">The <code style="color: #222222; background-color: #e6e6e6; padding: 1px 2px;">apigee</code> user is created on each VM.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: #222222; background-color: #e6e6e6; padding: 1px 2px;">apigee-service</code> utility is installed on each VM in case you have to log in to the VM to troubleshoot issues.</li>
</ul>

After the installation completes, use the Edge management API to provision an organization, and log in to the Edge UI to start creating API proxies. For more information, see [Understanding APIs and API proxies](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies).


### Install Optional Edge Components

During the install process, you can optionally choose to install additional Edge components, including the following:

* [Developer Services portal](http://docs.apigee.com/developer-services/content/what-developer-portal)
* [Edge SSO](https://docs.apigee.com/private-cloud/latest/supporting-saml-edge-private-cloud)
* [Monetization](http://docs.apigee.com/monetization/content/basics-monetization)

Installing these components may require you to perform additional onboarding or configuration steps.

Developer Services portal requires an SMTP server. If installed, it uses the same SMTP server as configured for Edge.
